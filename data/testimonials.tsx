          I load my PDFs and docs into Speechly and just listen on the go. Way easier than forcing myself to read after workðŸ”¥.

          No more staring at long articles, I hit play and let Speechly read it to me.<br /><br />Great for commuting or when I want to give my eyes a break. Can't recommend it enough.

          Perfect for work reports and study material. I catch up on docs while walking my dog. Total productivity boost.

          Honestly, it sounds more natural than I expected. I can listen to books, notes, even web pages.<br /><br />Thank you for building such an amazing TTS app!

          Love how it pronounces things correctly even with my local names. Super useful for accessibility.

          Speechly turns everything I need to read into audio. Now I "read" while cooking, driving, or at the gym. Absolute game changer.
