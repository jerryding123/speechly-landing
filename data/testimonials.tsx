          I dumped all my notes, docs, and photos in here and now I can actually find stuff. AI search is insaneðŸ”¥.

          No more digging through folders, I just ask Chronicle and it pulls up what I need.<br /><br />It lets me store all my important files and key moments in one place. Can't recommend it enough.

          Amazing for keeping track of everything from school and work. Found my old notes and documents in seconds.

          Honestly, it works better than expected. You can ask it about an event 10 years ago and it will find it.<br /><br />Thank you for creating such an amazing app!

          Love how it understands my voice notes even with my accent. Super useful.

          Chronicle remembers everything so I donâ€™t have to. I don't have to organize anything again, I just dump it into one app.
